# 16.19 development progress

Updated: 2026-09-24. Branch: `codex/16-19-development`.

- **Done:** The HN `16.19.820.7193` replay's 107 chunks and 2,035,757 blocks
  pass strict container/framing inspection with zero errors. The main CLI/API now
  select `hero_death` explicitly and write separate candidate victim/time records,
  with 88 HN, 64 KR and 51 KR events on three exact-build replays. Each run
  requires a matching route triad and all ten final death-count invariants.
- **Capability query:** `node src/cli.js capabilities <file.rofl> [--json]`
  reports the exact build's registered capabilities and known missing inputs
  from container metadata without decompressing packet chunks or using a runtime
  image. It labels 16.19 `hero_death` and `hero_death_timer` as unpublished
  `CANDIDATE` and leaves route and death-count validation pending until decode.
- **Done:** The exact HN runtime identifies `0x04d9` as `PKT_NPC_Hero_Die_s`,
  `0x02d6` as `PKT_S2C_UpdateDeathTimer_s`, and `0x0357` as
  `PKT_HeroReincarnateAlive_s`. Its five-byte timer transform yields seconds;
  88 HN timer candidates pair with Hero_Die, 85 match reincarnation within
  0–33 ms, and the remaining 3 predict a time after the Replay ends. CLI/API
  select this capability independently and write `hero_death_timer_candidates`.
  The captured image SHA-256 is
  `7e6804aa589a098a44b01e4fdc894fc697776caeea42fc78f780af11ed6df76d`;
  the decoder uses the recovered transform but does not read the image at run time.
- **Current:** Candidate participant identity and timer meaning are bounded to
  one HN Replay; KR uses different route IDs and reports `PROFILE_UNAVAILABLE`
  for the HN timer profile. No confirmed death, timer or respawn event is emitted.
- **Next:** Profile the KR timer route or resolve the HN hero level-up payload.
  Exact-image `PKT_NPC_LevelUp_s` route `0x02b3` has 159 hero-parameter packets,
  but four heroes' counts are below their final `LEVEL-1` totals; the level
  value transform is not established.
- **Blocked proof:** Broader timer validation and candidate victim mapping need
  independent replay evidence. The separate Riot client is `16.19.821.7343`
  and cannot supply a `16.19.820.7193` decoder image.

Research outputs, original replay data, and client binaries remain local and
outside Git. The 2026-08-21 published semantic baseline remains historical.
